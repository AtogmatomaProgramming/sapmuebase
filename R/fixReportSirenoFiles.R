#' Fix erroneus format of the reports from SIRENO in the 'observations' variable.
#' Sometimes in SIRENO, in 'observations' variable, a semicolon or a enter is
#' saved. When SIRENO generate the report files, the 'observations' variable is
#' exported as it is, with the semicolon and enter characteres. This means that
#' some lines of the file have more than the theorical number of variables (when
#' observations variable have a semicolon inside) or less than the theorical
#' (when a enter character is in the observations variable of the previous row).
#'
#' This function check the number of variables and works as follow:
#' - If the number of variables is the same of the theorical, there aren't any
#' changes.
#' - When there are more variables than theorical, the last variables are
#' collapsed in the last one and changed the ";" to "." inside the observations
#' variable
#' - When there are less variable than the theorical, we asume an enter has
#' been saved in the observations variable of the previous row and after
#' the enter there are more semicolons. The content of this row is added to the
#' variable observation of the previous row and the ";" is changed to ".".
#'
#' @param filename Filename of the file to check.
#' @param filetype Tipe of file: RIM_CATCHES, RIM_CATCHES_IN_LENGTHS,
#' RIM_LENGTHS, OAB_TRIPS, OAB_HAULS, OAB_CATCHES, OAB_LENGTHS, OAB_LITTER,
#' OAB_ACCIDENTAL
#' @param path Path of the file.
#' @param temporal If is True, the file is exported in a temporal directory. This is
#' usefull when this function is used with sapmbuenase import functions. When is
#' false, the fixed report is exported in the path location
#'
#' @note Use this function carefully, if the format or the sireno reports
#' changed can produce unexpected results. Furthermore, only is appropriate when
#' the 'observations' field is the last one of the row.
